      <td style="text-align:left">Re-activate employee</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Once an employee is de-activated the ULB admin can re-activate the employee
          in the system. It will automatically map the roles and responsibilities
          assigned earlier to the employee. UI provides the input field to capture
          the reason for re-activation and the supporting information for the same.</p>
