# Sewerage Rates

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Sewerage Charges are recurring charges levied for a pre-defined billing period. The billing period is configurable as per the state or ULB requirement. The rate for calculation of sewerage charges can vary widely and is dependent upon various parameters. For instance, they can be dependent either upon plot size slab combined with property usage type or solely dependent upon property usage type. In some cases, sewerage charges can also be levied as a percentage of water charges.
