# Water Rates \(Non-Metered\)

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

Water Charges are recurring charges levied for a pre-defined billing period. The billing period is configurable as per the state or ULB requirement. The rate for calculation of water charges vary widely and is dependent upon various parameters. Charges for water are dependent upon either plot size slab or No. of taps combined with property usage type. In some cases, they can also be solely dependent upon the property usage type.
