# FSM Release Notes

### Overview <a id="Overview"></a>

Emptying of septic tank / Pit \(Desludging\) request can be created by the citizen online which will be processed by the ULB. The processed request will then be assigned to a particular desludging operator post payment of desludging charges by the citizen.

The desludging operator then completes the emptying task on the ground and transports the faecal sludge to the designated septage treatment plant where a plan operator updates the vehicle log and septage dumped at the plant.
