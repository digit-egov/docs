# Fire NOC Fee

### Introduction

After the building usage and sub usage ontology has been defined for all the Firestations, the next step is to collect the Fire NOC fee that the citizens have to pay to obtain the certificate.

The Fire NOC fee is dependent on the following parameters:

1. Fire Station
2. Building Usage type
3. Building Sub usage type
4. Fire NOC type
