* **Support for New Role- State CSR** - The Grievance Counter is one of the channels through which citizens can file a complaint in person or through a telephone. There could be different types of counters both at ULB level or at State level, for example, CM helpline, local government-related helplines, etc. The first version of PGR has provision for ULB level counter where the employee \(ULB CSR\) can file complaints on behalf of the citizen. The current enhancement has provision for the additional role of state-level CSR who can file complaints or track status on behalf of citizens in any city in the state. This is irrespective of ULB where the CSR is registered. This provides a central monitoring capability to the State level CSR as well as improves the responsiveness by cutting down the time to redress a complaint.
* **Display the exact count of complaints assigned** - This feature focuses on showing the exact count of complaints the GRO \(Grievance Redressal Officer\) or LME \(Last-Mile Employee\) has in their Inbox. The GRO will have the visibility to all unassigned and assigned complaints. The LME will know the exact count of open complaints against his name. The initial version has only a count of complaints in GRO/LME Inbox which are displayed to that employee. Also, it had a restriction on the number of complaint records displayed, which was fixed at 200. This enhancement helps the GRO/LME to have a correct estimate of the work.
