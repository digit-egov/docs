        <p>On submitting an application by citizen or counter employee, it goes through
          the approval process. If the employee (Document verifier or field inspector)
          sees any discrepancy in the application they can send it back to the citizen
          for edits. Once reviewed and edited by the citizen the application will
          go through the complete approval flow as usual.</p>
