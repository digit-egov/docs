# Roadmap

### Roadmap Overview

Commitment and transparency are deeply ingrained values defining our product development approach. We are constantly developing new capabilities to facilitate the digital transformation of our cities. Take a glimpse into our DIGIT Roadmap to learn more about our upcoming tools and features.

| **Theme** | **Sub-Themes** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Urban Mission** | Product Enhancements - Urban | Most products in the urban stack have reached a stage of maturity where further feature development may not be required. Development of new features in these products should be taken up only if it helps deepen adoption, achieve logical completeness of the service and/or in response to a change in the external environment \(eg, a change in policy\). For such features, a go-ahead by the Product Council would suffice and a Gate-0 meeting would not be required. In all other cases, new features would require a Gate-0 approval. |
| **Adoption** | An important theme for FY2021-22 is to deepen the impact that our products have on citizens. A lot of our efforts through the year will be driven by keeping that end goal in mind. |   |
| **CDG** | As CDG gets institutionalised, we need to ensure that we put in place mechanisms that help them succeed. This will include setting up a robust demo environment for them to work off and building a product toolkit. |   |
| **New Missions** | Sanitation | This is a new mission for eGov. The scope is to work on a sanitation platform, with FSM being taken up in V1. |
| **IFIX** | This is a new mission for eGov. The scope is to work with the Punjab Govt. to deliver a PoC for IFIX. The initial use cases will be built around DWSS Punjab. |   |
| **Common Core** | Data Products | To empower and enable some of the other themes and objectives we have set for ourselves for the coming year, we will need to make decisions that are based on data. In the coming year, we will pick data products as a prominent theme that will help inform our decision-making as well as help our users \(citizens, govt. employees, administrators\) to leverage data more effectively. |
| **Platform Enhancements** | These are deliberate improvements on the platforms that will address some key issues like privacy, security as well as adding new capabilities like GIS. |   |
| **Research** | There are many more initiatives that we would like to take up and would like to understand them more deeply. Most of these would start off as research projects and depending on the outcome, would be incorporated within our missions. |   |
